New User:
- assigned to Property if created by SuperUser or Administration
- assigned to Property and Division if created by Division Manager
- assigned to Property, Division and Department if created by Department Manager



The Filters (sidebar) affect the S&T, ASP and Calendar pages:
- Administration (Property Manager) can see only their Property, but can use filters to see Divisions and Departments.
- Division Manager can see only their Property and Division, but can view all Departments.
- Department Manager (and below) can see only their Property, Division and Department.

Date Filters refer only to the Objective, Strategy or Tactic Start or Due date.
- except on the Calendar where Objectives are ignored
- on S&T and ASP pages, the Start and Due dates are seen as ranges and will appear if the current month/year is between them



When assigning a User to a Strategy, the user list is generated as:
- all users if current user is SuperUser
- all users belonging to the current Property if current user is Administration (Property Manager)
- all users belonging to the current Property and Division if current user is Division Manager
- all users belonging to the current Property, Division and Department if current user is Department Manager
- other users cannot create Strategies



When creating an Objective (ASP page) OR a Strategy without an Objective (S&T page):
- assigned to Property if user is Administration or SuperUser
- assigned to Division if user is Division Manager
- assigned to Department if user is Department Manager
- other users cannot create Objectives or Strategies without an Objective

A Strategy on the ASP page is always owned by an Objective and assigned to a User.
Objectives and Strategies always belong to a Competency.
